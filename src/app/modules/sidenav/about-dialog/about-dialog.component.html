  <p>
    WPI SGA's Treasury is an application that allows access to all of the financial data that SGA stores. It allows for
    both viewing by the WPI community and data entry by SGA Senators.
  </p>
  <h3>Previous Iterations</h3>
  <h4>Before Unified Treasury (Treasury Legacy)</h4>
  <p>
    Before there was a unified Treasury system, financial data was stored in a multitude of Google Sheets separated by
    fiscal year, access restrictions, and request types. Not only did this lead to duplicate data, it was not easily
    searchable. Additionally, with each new Treasurer, the format of the master fiscal year sheet, often restricted to
    SGA leadership, would be changed to either add, delete, or rename columns of data. This way was neither a
    sustainable system, nor a system that could be shared with the WPI Community.
  </p>
  <h4>Microsoft Access Treasury (Treasury MK1)</h4>
  <p>
    For the 2019 Senate, a position was created in SGA called Accountant. The purpose of the Accountant was to figure
    out a more sustainable way of storing and accessing all of the financial data we had while allowing for an
    easy way to add to it.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Accountant at the time, Kevin Bimonte, created a Microsoft Access database, later transferred
    to a MySQL back-end, was created with forms that allowed both input and viewing of the data. While this program is
    still in use for the time-being (current as of late 2021), it suffers from not being transparent with the WPI
    community and the requirement of creating database access keys for each user that needs to access the database.
  </p>
  <h4>Treasury Web (Treasury MK2)</h4>
  <p>
    Created by Mikel Matticoli and Sam Talpey as part of a Major Qualifying Project, Treasury Web was intended to
    succeed the Microsoft Access version of Treasury. However, due to a not easily expandable React based code-base,
    the project was ultimately replaced.

  <h3>Current Implementation (Treasury MK3)</h3>
  <p>
    Much like how Google scrapped Angular.JS to create Angular2, this project takes inspiration from Treasury MK2
    MQP but with a complete re-write. Built from the ground up, Treasury MK3 utilizes DotNet Core 5 for the API layer
    and Angular 12 with Angular Material for the front end to provide an easily expandable application.
